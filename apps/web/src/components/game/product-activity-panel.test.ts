/**
 * Every "xp to next" must say whose ladder it is.
 *
 * A reviewer read /companions and reported "two different names, two different
 * thresholds, and a progress bar that disagrees with its own label". They were right
 * about what they saw. /companions renders THREE ladders off the same total XP:
 *
 *   A. the garden creature's stage   sporeling 0 -> mossling 1,500 -> bracken 5,000
 *   B. the viewer's rank             Seedling 0 -> Sprout 500 -> Gardener 1,500
 *   C. the companion's own form      Beginning 0 -> Charged 100
 *
 * B and C both used to render inside ProductActivityPanel as bare fractions, and B sat
 * directly under the companion's name, so it read as the companion's rank. Nothing was
 * miscalculated; nothing was attributed either. These tests pin the attribution, so a
 * future edit cannot quietly drop it again.
 *
 * A and B are also deliberately pinned to each other at 1,500 (see the note in
 * titles.ts), which is what made two ladders look like one system. Attribution is what
 * makes them legible as two.
