/**
 * The reveal card must describe the draw the way the storage does.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A COMMENT: the card shipped a sentence that was true
 * before eggs existed and false after. Nothing failed when it went stale — the copy
 * and the data are separate nodes, the build stayed green, and the only signal was a
 * user who could not find the companion he had just been told he owned. The same
 * shape as the missing sign-in button: the UI lied, and the compiler had no opinion.
 *
 * What shipped and was wrong, verbatim:
 *   "New companion added to your collection"  for a draw sitting in `eggs`
 *   plus a "Make active" button, which `switchActiveCompanion` refuses for a
 *   companion that is not in the collection, so the button silently did nothing.
