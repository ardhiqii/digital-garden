/**
 * Which companion is dressed onto which repository.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM guest-profile.ts: the profile owns the
 * shape and its validation; this owns the RULE. The rule is the product
 * decision, and it is the part most likely to be re-tuned, so it lives where it
 * can be read and tested without a storage mock in the way.
 *
 * THE RULE, in one line: you can dress as many repositories as you own
 * companions, and each companion is spent on exactly one repository.
 *
 * WHY THE BOUND IS `collection.length` AND NOT "distinct species": the activity
 * panel already tells the user "N companions". If the collection says five and
 * only two repositories can be dressed because two of the five are the same
 * species, the number on screen is lying. Two Pikachu draws are two collection
 * entries and two usable companions. Whatever the collection displays is what
 * the bound must be, or the interface contradicts itself.
 *
 * WHY EACH COMPANION IS SPENT, NOT SHARED: sharing one companion across every
 * repository makes the bound meaningless. Owning one companion would dress a
 * hundred repositories, and the collection would stop being a resource you
 * manage. Spending is the reading that makes the collection mean something.
 *
 * WHY ASSIGNMENTS KEY ON `referenceId` AND NOT ON THE SPECIES: `companionId` is
 * a catalog id shared by every draw of that species (`pikachu-family`), so it
 * cannot distinguish the three Pikachu a user owns. `referenceId` is unique per
 * acquisition, which is exactly the identity being spent. The species travels
 * along on the assignment because the sprite lookup needs it, not because it
 * identifies anything.
 *
 * Pure and storage-free: every function takes a profile and returns a new one.
