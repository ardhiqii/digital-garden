/**
 * Carrying a signed-out guest's progress into their account.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: signing in used to switch which storage key the app read, and
 * nothing moved the data across. A user who had collected companions, opened eggs, and
 * earned XP while signed out would sign in and find a fresh starter, with their real
 * profile still sitting under the signed-out key. The split was invisible because the
 * pages that read each key disagreed about what they showed.
 *
 * WHAT PRODUCT.md 4.4 REQUIRES, and what this implements:
 *   - "If there is no server profile, import the current companion condition and
 *     collection; keep detailed local-note history on the device."
 *   - "Union collections and preserve each companion's XP independently."
 *   - "Keep the selected active companion when it still exists; otherwise ask the
 *     user to choose one."
 *
 * WHY IT MOVES RATHER THAN COPIES: leaving the guest profile in place would mean two
 * live profiles for one person, and the next sign-out would read the stale one. The
 * guest key is cleared only after the account key holds the merged result.
 *
 * Pure and storage-free: every function takes the two profiles and returns a plan. The
 * caller performs the writes, so a failure part-way through is visible at the call
 * site rather than hidden inside this module.
