/**
 * The activity log: what each companion actually earned, from what, when.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A READ MODEL, NOT A NEW STORE: the ledger already records
 * `companionId` and `occurredAt` per event, so "Gengar earned 25 xp from a
 * merged pull request in repo A" is already derivable. Nothing here writes.
 *
 * WHY IT SHOWS EVENTS THAT COUNTED ZERO: a log that only lists accepted events
 * cannot explain a quiet day. The user sees no entries and assumes the feature
 * is broken, when the real cause is a daily cap. So the log lists every event
 * and marks the ones a cap rejected, with the reason. An audit trail that hides
 * its own exclusions is not an audit trail.
 *
 * CONTENT RULE: this module reads only category, occurredAt, source, sourceId,
 * provenance, and the small display metadata bag. It never reads note text,
 * note titles, file paths, or repository contents. `activity-log.test.ts`
 * asserts that.
