 *
 * WHY 300, NOT 250: the note categories are capped, but `merged-pull-request`,
 * `published-release`, `closed-linked-issue` and `successful-ci` carry no cap of
 * their own, so the budget is the ONLY limit on a heavy GitHub day. At 250 a
 * plausible sprint close-out (eight merged pull requests, four green builds, plus
 * the activity ceiling) totals 270 and was clipped by 20: the ceiling punished
 * real work, the one thing it must never do. 300 clears every honest
 * single-source day measured: notes maxed 191, a heavy GitHub day 270, a typical
 * mixed day 119. It still binds where it matters, because both sources maxed
 * together reach 461 and are held to 300.

 * modification time, which the caps deliberately stopped trusting because it is
 * user-settable. Bucketing the budget by `occurredAt` therefore reopened the
 * exact hole the content caps closed: one scan's events all survive a single cap
 * bucket, then scatter across as many budget days as the user forged mtimes for,
 * so the day's sum is never bounded.
 *
 * The trusted day is already in the cap key (`...:<YYYY-MM-DD>:<category>`, for
 * both the note and GitHub producers), so it is read from there when a cap
 * exists. GitHub events without a cap carry a server-supplied `occurredAt`,
 * which is trustworthy, so they fall back to it.
 *
 * The day is the LAST date-shaped segment: the category names contain no date,
 * while a source id in the middle of a GitHub key theoretically could.

 *
 * The budget is evaluated per day across all sources, so its behaviour does not
