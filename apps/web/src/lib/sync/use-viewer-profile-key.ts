/**
 * The storage key for the current viewer's product profile.
 *
 * WHY A HOOK AND NOT A CONSTANT: the key depends on who is signed in, which only the
 * server knows. Five surfaces read a profile and four of them hard-coded the
 * signed-out key, so a signed-in user saw one active companion on `/github` and a
 * different one everywhere else.
 *
 * WHY `null` MEANS "NOT YET KNOWN": the session arrives after the first paint (the
 * endpoint is deliberately uncached so it can never serve one visitor's identity to
 * another). A component that guessed the signed-out key before the answer arrived
 * would read the wrong profile for a moment and, worse, might write to it. Callers
 * must wait for a non-null key.
 *
 * WHY THE FETCH IS SHARED: the navbar badge, the picker, and the runtime can all be
 * on screen at once. A module-level promise means they make one request between
 * them rather than one each.

 * landed on `/companions`, the page that LISTS the eggs, found no egg, no badge, and no
 * profile at all. Measured: a fresh browser on `/companions` had nothing; one visit to
 * `/write` produced the egg. Landing on the wrong page decided whether the day counted,
 * which is the same defect the guest import had before it moved to this resolver.
 *
 * This runs on every route because the navbar calls `startViewerSession`, and it runs
 * before any surface is handed the key, so no reader can see the pre-draw state.
 *
 * Idempotent twice over: `ensureBrowserGuestProfile` returns the existing profile, and
 * `claimDailyDraw` refuses a day already in `processedTriggerIds`. A replay is a no-op
 * rather than a second egg.
